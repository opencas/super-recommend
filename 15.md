### 简介：

"Filght Rules" 一词源自加拿大第一位太空宇航员 Chris Hadfield 的 *An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth* 一书，原意为告诉宇航员在遇到问题时应该怎样操作的指导手册。

> Flight Rules are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals that list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and why. Essentially, they are extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard operating procedures. [...]

> NASA has been capturing our missteps, disasters and solutions since the early 1960s, when Mercury-era ground teams first started gathering "lessons learned" into a compendium that now lists thousands of problematic situations, from engine failure to busted hatch handles to computer glitches, and their solutions.

—— Chris Hadfield, *An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth*.
